# Background
I've always been fascinated by the Olympics‚Äîthe competition, the athletes, and the stories behind every medal. This project started as a way to explore the history of the Games through data. Using SQL, I analyzed participation trends, medal counts, and standout performances to uncover patterns and insights. The goal was to go beyond just numbers and truly understand how nations and athletes have shaped the Olympics over the years.

Data hails from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/olympic-data). It contains information about every game held from 1896 - 2016, the teams, countries, games, athletes and sports played.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1.	How many olympics games have been held?
2.	List down all Olympics games held so far.
3.	Mention the total no of nations who participated in each olympics game?
4.	Which year saw the highest and lowest no of countries participating in olympics?
5.	Which nation has participated in all of the olympic games?
6.	Identify the sport which was played in all summer olympics.
7.	Which Sports were just played only once in the olympics?
8.	Fetch the total no of sports played in each olympic games.
9.	Fetch details of the oldest athletes to win a gold medal.
10.	Find the Ratio of male and female athletes participated in all olympic games.
11.	Fetch the top 5 athletes who have won the most gold medals.
12.	Fetch the top 5 athletes who have won the most medals (gold/silver/bronze).
13.	Fetch the top 5 most successful countries in olympics. Success is defined by no of medals won.
14.	List down total gold, silver and broze medals won by each country.
15.	List down total gold, silver and broze medals won by each country corresponding to each olympic games.
16.	Identify which country won the most gold, most silver and most bronze medals in each olympic games.
17.	Identify which country won the most gold, most silver, most bronze medals and the most medals in each olympic games.
18.	Which countries have never won gold medal but have won silver/bronze medals?
19.	In which Sport/event, Nigeria has won highest medals.
20.	Break down all olympic games where Nigeria won medal for Hockey and how many medals in each olympic games.
# Tools I used
To carry out this analysis, I relied on a combination of tools that made querying, managing, and sharing the data more efficient. Here's why I chose each one:

- **SQL:** The backbone of this project, used to extract insights from the Olympic dataset.

- **MySQL:** A powerful relational database management system for storing and querying the data.

- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to code editor for writing and testing SQL queries efficiently.

- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts with others.
# The Analysis
This project involved running a series of SQL queries to explore different aspects of the Olympic Games. From identifying the countries that have participated the most to analyzing medal trends and standout athletes, each query provided valuable insights. Below are some of the key analyses and the insights gained from them.

### 1. How many Olympic Games have been held?
To identify how many games have been held, I counted the number of unique games held so far over the years.
This ensured I got a list of unique Olympic events, without duplicates. By sorting the results in ascending order, I was able to easily identify and count the total number of distinct Olympic Games, which gave me a comprehensive overview of the Games held from 1896 to 2016.
```sql
SELECT 
    DISTINCT games 
FROM 
    athlete_events
ORDER BY 
    games;
```
Based on the results, a total of 48 Olympic Games have been held, including both Summer and Winter editions. The earliest Olympics started in 1896, and the most recent one listed is the 2016 Summer Olympics. The Games are held in a cycle, with the Winter Olympics taking place every four years between the Summer Games.

### 2. Which nation has participated in all Olympic Games? 
To answer this question, I used a combination of SQL Common Table Expressions (CTEs). First, I counted the total number of distinct Olympic Games by selecting unique `games` from the `athlete_events` table. Next, I joined the `athlete_events` table with the `noc_regions` table to identify the countries that participated in each Olympic event. After grouping by both the `games` and the country (from `noc_regions`), I counted how many Olympic Games each country participated in. Finally, I compared these counts with the total number of Games and retrieved the countries that participated in all of them. 

```sql
WITH tot_games AS
(
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT games) AS total_games -- Counting the total number of games
    FROM athlete_events
),
-- retrieving the countries that participated in each game
countries as
(
    SELECT games, nr.region as country
    FROM athlete_events ah JOIN noc_regions nr  
    ON ah.NOC = nr.NOC
    GROUP BY games, nr.region -- grouping by games and country
),
-- counting the total number of games each country participated in
participating_countries as
(
    SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS total_games_participated
    FROM countries
    GROUP BY country
)
-- retriving the countries that participated in all the games
SELECT pc.*
FROM participating_countries pc
JOIN tot_games tg
ON tg.total_games = pc.total_games_participated
ORDER BY 1;
```

The result shows that **France, Italy, Switzerland, and the UK** have participated in all 51 Olympic Games.

### 3. Identify the sport which was played in all Summer Olympics
To answer this question, I first counted the total number of distinct Summer Olympic Games by filtering the athlete_events table for rows where the season is 'Summer'. Then, I identified all the sports that were part of each Summer Olympic Games. After grouping by sport and counting how many times each sport participated in the Summer Olympics, I compared these counts to the total number of Summer Games. 

```SQL
WITH total_summer_games as
(
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT games) AS total_summer_games
    FROM athlete_events
    WHERE season = 'Summer'
),
-- retriving the sport that participated in each summer game
summer_sports AS
(
    SELECT  DISTINCT games, sport
    FROM athlete_events
    WHERE season = 'Summer'
),
-- counting the total number of games each sport participated in
participating_sports AS
(
    SELECT sport, COUNT(*) AS total_games_participated
    FROM summer_sports
    GROUP BY sport
)
-- retriving the sports that participated in all the summer games
SELECT ps.*
FROM participating_sports ps
JOIN total_summer_games tg
ON tg.total_summer_games = ps.total_games_participated
ORDER BY 1;
```
The result shows that **Athletics, Cycling, Fencing, Gymnastics, and Swimming** were played in all 29 Summer Olympic Games.
